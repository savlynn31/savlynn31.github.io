				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>Hi! I'm Savannah. I love to create beautiful, user-friendly websites.</p>
				<p>Some of you might know that I used to be a first grade teacher. I loved the creative side of teaching--making lesson plans, decorating my classroom, organizing all of my students' paperwork! However I soon realized I wanted to spend even more of my day creating. It was then that I discovered my passion for web design.</p>
				<p>Since I had just completed a Masters at the University of Florida, I couldn't afford to go back to school full-time. I instead pieced together an education on my own. I took some courses at Santa Fe College in fine art and Graphic Design, and then I was on my own. I borrowed books from the library, took free courses on YouTube and other learning sites, obsessively read blogs and social media feeds, really anything I could do to absorb myself in the field.</p>
				<p>It took a lot of hard work! I had to dedicate myself to my studies. Nobody was making me. I didn't have any tests or papers due. I was the only one who dictated how long and hard I worked to achieve my goals. But I finally made it! Now I love what I do--creating awesome websites!</p>
